// Assignment:		Project 2
// Filename:		poly.h
// Purpose:		Definition of the Polynomial Class
//			This class provides the user the functionality of a polynomial, including
//			the ability to add terms, evaluate, and multiply the coefficients.
//			It also provides basic set and get functionality.
//			A function is provided to read terms from a file, and two associated 
//			non-member, non-friend stream operators are present for reading a Term 
//			and outputting the Polynomial in its entirety.
