# Polynomials
Provides the user the functionality of a polynomial, including the ability to add terms, evaluate, and multiply the coefficients. It also provides basic set and get functionality. A function is provided to read terms from a file, and two associated non-member, non-friend stream operators are present for reading a Term and outputting the Polynomial in its entirety.
